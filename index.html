        <h3>Here's a time line of Mr.Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Life.</h3><br><br>
        <p id="intro"><strong>Who is MS Dhoni?</strong><br>Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a former Indian international cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. <br>Under his captaincy, India won the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective "finisher" in limited-overs formats.<br>He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wicket-keeper batsmen and captains in the history of the game.He was also the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODI cricket.</p><br><br>
        <p id="early"><strong>Early Career</strong><br>In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team.[32] Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in class 12th in school, had played only school cricket and club cricket and no professional cricket.<br>Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season, as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against Assam cricket team.<br>He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.</p><br><br>
        <p id="intl"><strong>International Career</strong><br>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[62] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.<br></p><br><br>
        <p id="captain"><strong>Indian Captaincy</strong><br>Dhoni was named the captain of Indian squad for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 held in South Africa in September 2007.[138] India were crowned champions as Dhoni led the team to victory against Pakistan in a thrilling contest.[139] He went on to become the ODI captain of the Indian team for the seven-match ODI series against Australia in September 2007.</p><br><br>
        <p id="ipl"><strong>IPL Career</strong><br><br>
          Dhoni was contracted by the Chennai Super Kings for US$1.5 million. This made him the most expensive player in the IPL for the first season auctions. Under his captaincy, Chennai Super Kings won the 2010 and 2011 and 2018 Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 and 2014 Champions League T20 titles.<br>
After the suspension of CSK for two years, he was bought by Rising Pune Supergiant for US$1.9  million in 2016, and was named captain. However, his team finished in 7th place. In 2017, his team reached the final, where they lost to Mumbai Indians.<br>
In the 2018 IPL season, Chennai Super Kings returned to IPL, and Dhoni was again selected to lead the franchise. Dhoni scored 455 runs in the tournament and led his side to their third IPL title.</p><br><br>
